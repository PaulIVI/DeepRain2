# DeepRain
This project is a team project which was carried out during the MSI Master at the [HTWG Konstanz - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.htwg-konstanz.de). 

The  goal  of  the  present  work  is  to  examine  whether  it  is  possible  to  calculate  a  rainfallforecast with limited resources and to make it available to users. For the calculation of therain forecast neural networks were used. The required historical and current radar data wereobtained from the German Weather Service and then analyzed and processed.  
Furthermore, an app was developed in which the rain forecasts are visualized. 
It also offers the possibility tonotify the user in case of imminent rain.
